Create a script that parses the /etc/passwd file and creates a hash with only the accounts that have /bin/bash listed as their shell. Use the UID as the key value, and the username as the hash value.
Print a header of "The following accounts are using bash as their shell:" with the column headers UID and Username beneath it.
Print out the contents of the hash with the key and hash values lined up under the header.
